# 👋 ¡Hello, mundo!

We are [Maximiliana](https://maximiliana.es/), the Spanish startup that has developed the world's first elderly-friendly modern smartphone. From our offices in Zaragoza, we work hard to make technology accessible, useful, and easy to use for our grandparents.

## 🔥 Features of our device

📹 Easy video calls, which are answered automatically without the user needing to touch the device.

☎️ Easy phone calls, with custom answer policies, whitelists, and more.

📡 Complete telemetry for the family: they can check battery, location, and availability from their personal devices.

📱 Third-party apps. Under the hood, Maximiliana is an Android device that can run any Play Store app.

🎮 Full remote control. The whole family can use our Control Center app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.maximiliana.controlcenter) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/maximiliana/id1594157973) to configure the device.

## 📊 Our company

We are a company that is fully focused on the technology behind our product; we design and develop all of our products and code in-house because we believe it is the only way to deliver the best experience to our customers. More **than 2,000 active devices all around the world** prove us right. To make this possible, we rely on many tools we love, some of which are FOSS, such as [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/), [GraphQL](https://github.com/topics/graphql), [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs), and many more.
